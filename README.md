## Abstract

This project presents a real-time DSP-based music genre classification system that combines handcrafted feature extraction with deep learning techniques. The system integrates classical machine learning models—K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Boosted Trees—with a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on mel-spectrograms. The hybrid model achieves high accuracy and low latency suitable for real-time applications such as music streaming platforms, DJ software, and media organization tools.


## Problem Statement

Classical approaches used features like MFCCs and models such as k-NN or SVM to achieve ~70% accuracy. With the rise of deep learning, CNNs operating on spectrogram images boosted performance beyond 85%. However, real-time constraints limit deep model usage on low-resource platforms. This work proposes a hybrid DSP + CNN solution to achieve both speed and performance. So the goal is to design a music genre classification system that balances:

- High accuracy using deep learning
- Low latency using classical models
- Real-time feasibility for live applications

### DSP Features Extracted

- **Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)** – captures timbral textures
- **Spectral Descriptors** – centroid, rolloff, flux, ZCR
- **Rhythmic Features** – beat strength, BPM, tempo variance
- **Harmonic Features** – pitch histograms, chroma vectors

### CNN on Mel-Spectrograms

- **Preprocessing**:
  - Frame audio with 2048-sample windows, 50% overlap
  - Apply FFT, Mel filterbanks, and log compression
  - Generate 64×128 mel-spectrogram image for 3s audio clips

- **CNN Architecture**:
  - Two Conv layers (64 filters, 3×3 and 3×5)
  - Max-pooling (2×4)
  - One dense layer (32 units) + Softmax
  - Dropout: 0.3, Optimizer: Adam (lr = 0.001)


## Performance Comparison

| Model           | Accuracy | Precision | Recall |
|----------------|----------|-----------|--------|
| k-NN           | 60.5%    | 0.61      | 0.60   |
| SVM            | 68.7%    | 0.70      | 0.69   |
| Boosted Trees  | 75.4%    | 0.76      | 0.75   |
| CNN            | 83.0%    | 0.84      | 0.83   |
| **Hybrid Model** | **85.0%** | **0.86** | **0.85** |

> The hybrid model provides the best overall performance with low latency and high generalization.
